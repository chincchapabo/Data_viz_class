# Reflection




# My first plot

I wish I knew more about cars so I knew what hwy and displ were and what they are good for. Would help to have a driving license I guess. 

```{r load-libraries-data, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, include=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)

setwd("~/Data_viz_class")
cars <- read_csv("data/cars.csv")
```

```{r Plot of cars dataset, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
ggplot(cars, aes(x = displ, y = hwy, color = as.factor(year))) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE)

```
